1. Comparative execution time as well as analysis of the performance of different kernels (how many times faster, why is it faster, overheads in calling the kernel, etc.)

2. Screenshot of the program output with correctness check (C)

3. screenshot of the program output including correctness check (x86-64)

4. screenshot of the program output including correctness check (SIMD YMM register)

5. screenshot of the program output including correctness check (CUDA, optional)
